# 8051 Microcontroller Projects with Proteus Simulation
# Overview
This repository contains various projects developed using the 8051 microcontroller and simulated in Proteus. Each project demonstrates different functionalities and uses of the 8051 microcontroller, showcasing a wide range of applications in embedded systems.
# Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/harikrishnan178/8051-microcontroller-projects
Open the .dsn file in Proteus to view and run the simulation.
The source code for the 8051 microcontroller is located in the Code folder. You can compile the code using Keil or any other 8051 IDE.
Load the generated HEX file into the Proteus simulation for testing.
# Prerequisites
Proteus: To simulate the circuit.
